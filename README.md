# capstone-project-webscraping

This project involves Web-Scraping by using both BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

The program first finds all the available houses for rent in San Francisco, takes the prices, addresses and the links to the particular home's website by scraping through the data using "BeautifulSoup" in the form of lists.

And then it automatically writes onto the google form in their respective fields.

Then all these responses are stored in the form of a .csv file.
